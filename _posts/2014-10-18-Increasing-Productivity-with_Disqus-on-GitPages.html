# Git Pages or Github Pages#
This is a git page. We are using git pages to replace word documents, powerpoint presentations, emails, etc. that you would typically use to describe research concepts on a day to day basis to other researchers. The main advantages are centrality and accessibility saving time wasted looking for emails, attachments, documents that are buried and/or outdated.

# Disqus  
Disqus is an comment posting service used by many different web services including Github. Anyone with a Disqus account can leave comments on a git page, no Github account required.

# Workflow using Git Pages and Disqus in between physical meetings #
1. Student has some results or question which requires some discussion.
2. Student makes a git page on the GOALI project website.
3. Student emails (not very fancy) the GOALI group that their input is desired, includes link to git page
4. GOALI group members leave comments using Disqus (preferably not email).
5. Student addresses comments with Disqus, updated post, new Git Page, or in the next meeting.

Any thoughts?
