### Miller-Bravias Coordinate System

In HCP material systems, it is convenient to employ the 4-index Miller-Bravais (M-B) coordinate system to describe slip directions and slip plane normals.  The basal plane contains three directions $$ (a_1, a_2, a_3) $$ that form angles of 120$$^\circ$$ with each other and one direction $$ (c) $$ that is perpendicular to the basal plane.  With this particular system, the symmetry of the directions is apparent through the shuffling of the 3 non-zero indices.  For example, the basal slip directions in the 4-index M-B coordinate system are $$ [\bar{1}2\bar{1}0] $$, $$ [\bar{2}110] $$, and $$ [\bar{1}\bar{1}20] $$.  

However, determining direction cosines directly from the 4-index M-B coordinate system can be somewhat confusing because it is not orthonormal.  Therefore, we will step through the procedure for moving from a 4-index M-B coordinate system to an orthonormal system.

The first step is to convert the 4-index system to a 3-index system.  This is done by eliminating the $$ a_3 $$ direction.  Let's assume the 4-index indices are $$ [ u v t w] $$ and the 3-index indices are $$ [U V W] $$.  The conversion follows:

$$ U = u - t; V = v - t; W = w $$

Now that we have a 3-direction coordinate sysem, A simple transformation is performed to convert the 3-index M-B $$ [U V W] $$ to the orthonormal system $$ [x, y, z] $$.  The conversion follows:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{c}{a} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} U \\ V \\ W \end{bmatrix} $$

Note that this transformation aligns two directions, $$ a_1 \| x $$ and $$ c \| z $$.
