## Introduction

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is critical to countless applications in technology and science. One such application is in the discrete representation of sophisticated functions in multiple dimensions.

Instead of interpolating between sampled values of the function in real space, this approximation can be done in DFT space using a technique called **spectral interpolation**. This post describes the technique and gives examples of its use in 1D and 2D.

## 1D Interpolation

First we write the original function:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) = -0.75sin(x) + 0.25cos(3x)
\end{equation}
$$

The function $$ f(x) $$ is periodic over the domain $$ 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi $$. If $$ f(x) $$ were not periodic the DFT method would be less effective, as the DFT assumes periodicity. In this case the function is generally mirrored over the y-axis (to make it periodic over the domain $$ -2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi $$ and of at least $$ C^0 $$ continuity).

The first step is to sample the function over a regular interval. These samples are the input to the DFT. In the following image the blue line is $$ f(x) $$ while the green cirles represent the sampled values of the function.

The following image shows the real and imaginary components of the frequencies of the DFT. Notice the symmetry in both real and imaginary components.

## 2D Interpolation

The original function is as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x_1,x_2) = -0.85sin(x_1) + 0.15cos(2x_1) + 0.5sin(x_2)
\end{equation}
$$
