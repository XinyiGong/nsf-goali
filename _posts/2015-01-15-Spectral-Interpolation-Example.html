## Introduction

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is critical to countless applications in technology and science. One such application is in the discrete representation of sophisticated functions in multiple dimensions. Sometimes

Instead of interpolating between sampled values of the function in real space, this approximation can be done in DFT space using a technique called **spectral interpolation**. This post describes the technique and gives examples of its use in 1D and 2D.

## 1D Interpolation

First we show the original function:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) = -0.75sin(x) + 0.25cos(3x)
\end{equation}
$$

The function $$ f(x) $$ is periodic over the domain $$ 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi $$. If $$ f(x) $$ were not periodic the DFT method would be less effective, as the DFT assumes periodicity. In this case we would mirror the function over the y-axis (to make it periodic over the domain $$ -2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi $$ and of at least $$ C^0 $$ continuity).

First we sample the function over a regular interval. These samples are the input to the DFT. In the following image the blue line is $$ f(x) $$ while the green cirles represent the 16 sampled values of the function.

By taking the DFT of the samples using the FFT algorithm, we represent the function in frequency space. The following image shows the real and imaginary components of the frequencies of the DFT. Notice the symmetry in both real and imaginary components.

Now imagine that we don't know the original function and only have the 16 sampled values. What can we do if we want to know the value of the function at locations between the sampled values? One option would be to use linear interpolation between 2 sampled data points. This is fine, but as the function isn't linear this will introduce error. Higher order polynomial fits are an option, but these become computationally expensive to compute. Spectral interpolation is advantageous because it allows us to "fill in" between the original sampled values and do so for the entire domain of the function through a single computation. 

This interpolation is performed through "zero-padding." By inserting zeros into the DFT at a specific location the number of frequencies increases. Since the number of samples in real space matches the number of frequencies in the DFT, zero padding in frequency space increases the number of values in real space as well. So long as the function was sufficiently sampled in real space spectral interpolation finds the intermediate values

## 2D Interpolation

The original function is as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x_1,x_2) = -0.85sin(x_1) + 0.15cos(2x_1) + 0.5sin(x_2)
\end{equation}
$$
