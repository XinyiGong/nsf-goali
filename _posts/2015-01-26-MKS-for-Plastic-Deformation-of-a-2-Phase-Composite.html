## Introduction

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prediction of total strain using the MKS framework. Two - phase composite microstructures with isotropic phases were chosen to simplify the problem. The goal was to calibrate with plastic FEM simulations and predict the total strain at each voxel location (elastic strain + plastic strain). 

## Study 1

### Parameters
* 2 phase microstructures with isotropic phases
* Both phases exhibit elastic, perfectly plastic behavior
* 0.15% applied strain amplitude
* Periodic boundary conditions
  * uniaxial tension
  * contraction not allowed on transverse sides of MVE (BCs for elasticity)
  
#### Phase 1 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 100 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 100 MPa

#### Phase 2 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 100 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 125 MPa

_The following image shows the stress-strain curves for both phases superimposed_

#### Calibration Set:
* 50% volume fraction
* 50 random microstructures

#### Validation Sets:
* 3 sets: 30% VF, 50% VF, 70% VF
* 10 random microstructures in each set 

### Results

_The following chart shows the errors seen in the 10 validation microstructures_

* Mean % Error: mean error per voxel in all microstructures  
* Average Maximum % Error: max error per microstructure 
* Absolute Maximum % Error: max error in any microstructure

## Study 2

### Parameters
* 2 phase microstructures with isotropic phases
* Both phases exhibit elastic, perfectly plastic behavior
* 0.10625% - 0.18750% applied strain amplitude
* Periodic boundary conditions
  * uniaxial tension
  * contraction allowed on transverse sides of SVE (BCs for plasticity)
  
#### Phase 1 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 100 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 100 MPa

#### Phase 2 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 100 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 125 MPa

#### Calibration Set:
* 200 random microstructures
* Volume fractions equally dispersed between 1% and 99%

#### Validation Sets:
* 50 random microstructures
* Volume fractions equally dispersed between 1% and 99%

### Results
