## Introduction
In this study the MKS was used to predict total strain fields in a 2-phase composite where each phase was assigned properties from distinct orientation of $\alpha$-Ti single crystals. The properties from especially "soft" and "hard" orientations were used in order to simulate the worst case scenario in a fully polycrystalline simulation. 

### Parameters
* 2 phase microstructures with isotropic phases
* Both phases exhibit elastic, perfectly plastic behavior
* 0.814% applied strain amplitude
* Periodic boundary conditions
  * uniaxial tension
  * contraction allowed on transverse sides of MVE (BCs for plasticity)
  
#### Phase 1 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 115 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 800 MPa

#### Phase 2 Parameters:
* Young's Modulus: 145 GPa
* Poisson's Ratio: 0.3
* Yield Strength: 1200 MPa

#### Calibration Set:
* 399 realistic $\alpha$-Ti microstructures generated in DREAM.3D by Matthew Priddy
* Phases randomly assigned to grains in DREAM.3D microstructure
* Volume fraction varied between 5% and 95%

#### Validation Sets:
* 400 realistic $\alpha$-Ti microstructures generated in DREAM.3D by Matthew Priddy
* Phases randomly assigned to grains in DREAM.3D microstructure
* Volume fraction varied between 5% and 95%

### Results
When only first order terms were used in the MKS procedure the following errors resulted:
* Mean Error: 2.49%
* Average Maximum Error: 21.65% 
* Absolute Maximum Error: 44.28%

where:
* Mean % Error: mean error per voxel in all microstructures  
* Average Maximum % Error: max error per microstructure 
* Absolute Maximum % Error: max error in any microstructure 

The following image shows a slice of the microstructure, the FE strain field and the MKS prediction of the strain field given the original microstructure:
