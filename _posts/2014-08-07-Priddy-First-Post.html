## Matthew Priddy's First Post

Our hopes for this blog-type structure are to provide the student collaborators with a way to communicate issues and disseminate real-time updates.s

One thing that seems to be nice to do with this is inserting LaTeX equations into our posts.  For example. the plastic velocity gradient defined in terms of the shearing rate, slip directions, and slip plane normal directions is:

$$ \mathbf{L}_0^\mathrm{p} =
\sum_{\alpha=1}^{\mathrm{N}}\dot{\gamma}^{(\alpha)}\left(\mathbf{s}_0^{(\alpha)} \otimes \mathbf{n}_0^{(\alpha)}\right) = \dot{\mathbf{F}}^{\mathrm{p}} \cdot \left({\mathbf{F}^{\mathrm{p}}}\right)^{-1} $$
