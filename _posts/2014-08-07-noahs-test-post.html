# Biography

My name is Noah Paulson. I'm graduate research assistant at the Georgia Institute of Technology and I'm studying for my PhD in Mechanical Engineering. I was raised in Lexington, Massachusetts and stayed nearby for college, graduating with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Tufts University in 2013. I am currently a member of the MINED research group, and I am co-advised by Dr. Surya Kalidnidi and Dr. David McDowell at Georgia Tech and Dr. Donald Shih from Boeing. I am interested in computational and data-science approches in the analysis of structural materials.
