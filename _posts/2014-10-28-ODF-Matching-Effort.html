### Procedure to Perform ODF Matching

Where $ Y_coeff $ is the set of GSH coefficients we are trying to match, and $ X_coeff $ is a matrix of GSH coefficients for each selected oriention which have been properly scaled.

$ K =  \frac{e^{-0.25l^{2}w^{2}} - e^{-.25(l+1)^{2}w^{2}}}{1 -  e^{ -0.25w^{2}} } $

where $ w $ is the gaussian half-width and

$ w = 5 % degrees

### Selection of Orientations

* Orientations selected from Hexagonal-Triclinic fundamental zone ($ 0 \leq \phi_1 \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \Phi < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \phi_2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3}
$)

* The fundamental zone was uniformly binned and a single orientation was selected from the center of each bin for a total of 360 orientaions.
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_1 = 24 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \Phi = 15 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_2 = 12 $ degrees

_The image below shows the unique orientations selected from the hexagonal - triclinic fundamental zone_
