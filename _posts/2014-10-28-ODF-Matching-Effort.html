### Selection of Orientations

* Orientations selected from Hexagonal-Triclinic fundamental zone ($ 0 \leq \phi_1 \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \Phi < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \phi_2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3}
$)

* The fundamental zone was uniformly binned and a single orientation was selected from the center of each bin for a total of 360 orientaions.
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_1 = 24 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \Phi = 15 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_2 = 12 $ degrees

_The image below shows the unique orientations selected from the hexagonal - triclinic fundamental zone_
