### Problem Definition

The following conditions are imposed to constrain the solution:

$$ \begin{equation} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N v_i = 1 \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} 0 \leq v_i \leq 1 \end{equation} $$

### Optimization Using FMINCON

The following equation is minimized using Matlab's FMINCON

  f = @(V) sum(conj(Y_coeff - X_coeff*V).*(Y_coeff - X_coeff*V) );

  [x,fval,exitflag,output] = fmincon(f,Vo,[],[],Aeq,beq,lb,ub,[],options);


* $ Y_{coeff} $: The set of GSH coefficients from the OIM software representing the actual ODF

* $ X_{coeff} $: An array of GSH coefficients for each selected oriention which have been properly scaled (details are shown in the next section)

* $ V $ : Vector of volume fractions associated with each selected orientation

The constraints on the solution were imposed as shown in the following Matlab code:

  % an initial guess for the volume fractions of each orientation
  Vo = (1/size(X_coeff,2))*ones(size(X_coeff,2),1);
  % Aeq * x = beq
  Aeq = ones(size(X_coeff,2),size(X_coeff,2));
  beq = ones(size(X_coeff,2),1);
  % lb =< x <= ub
  lb = zeros(size(X_coeff,2),1);
  ub = ones(size(X_coeff,2),1);

### Procedure to Perform ODF Matching

$$ \begin{equation} C_l^{\mu\nu} = \frac{2l + 1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N K\dot{\ddot{T}}_l^{\mu\nu}(g_i) \end{equation} $$



$$ \begin{equation} K =  \frac{e^{-0.25l^{2}w^{2}} - e^{-.25(l+1)^{2}w^{2}}}{1 -  e^{ -0.25w^{2}} } \end{equation} $$

where $ w $ is the gaussian half-width and

$ w = 5 $ degrees

### Selection of Orientations

* Orientations selected from Hexagonal-Triclinic fundamental zone ($ 0 \leq \phi_1 \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \Phi < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \phi_2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3}
$)

* The fundamental zone was uniformly binned and a single orientation was selected from the center of each bin for a total of 360 orientaions.
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_1 = 24 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \Phi = 15 $ degrees
  * Bin spacing in $ \phi_2 = 12 $ degrees
