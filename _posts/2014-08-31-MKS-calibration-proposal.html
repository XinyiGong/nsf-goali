## Introduction

### What is the MKS?
+ The **Materials Knowledge System (MKS)** is a computationally efficient method for the prediction of tensor fields (eg. elastic strain, temperature)
+ A one-time calibration is performed with fields from representative microstructures in the materials system
+ Influence coefficients from the calibration are used to estimate the response fields of arbitrary microstructures


_The basic MKS equation:_	{{page.mks_eq}}

### Problem Statement
+ To develop computationally efficient methods for the calibration of elastic MKS in high contrast composite systems
+ This is a **structure - property** linkage

## Datasets

### Source of Structure Datasets
+ Datasets will be synthetically generated

### Details of Structure Datasets
+ Two phase composite microstructures
+ Isotropic phases
+ Phases have contrast in elastic moduli of 10:1 (eg., E_a_ = 200GPa, E_b_ = 20GPa)
+ 3-D microstructures, 21 x 21 x 21 elements

## Proposed Workflow
+ Brainstorm effective data-science methods for more efficient calibration
	+ Example path 1: refine regression methods for calibration procedure
	+ Example path 2: devise iterative calibration scheme
	+ Example path 3: optimize selection of calibration microstructures
+ Generate an appropriate set of microstructures for both calibration and validation purposes
+ Visualize the MKS influence coefficients (they represent a reduced dimensional structure - property linkage)
+ Compare the efficiency and accuracy of the new methods in comparison with traditional approaches using maximum error and mean absolute strain error measures
