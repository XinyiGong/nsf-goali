# Git Pages or Github Pages#
This is a git page. We are using git pages to replace word documents, powerpoint presentations, emails, etc. that you would typically use to describe research concepts on a day to day basis to other researchers. The main advantages are centrality and accessibility saving time wasted looking for emails, attachments, documents that are buried and/or outdated.

# Disqus  
Disqus is an comment posting service used by many different web services including Github. Anyone with a Disqus account can leave comments on a git page, no Github account required.

# Workflow using Git Pages and Disqus in between physical meetings #
1. Student has some results or question which requires some discussion.
2. Student makes a git page on the GOALI project website.

Scenario A: discussion through email
3a. Student emails the GOALI group that their input is desired, includes link to git page.
4a. GOALI group members provide thoughts through email. If information is generated that should be included on a gitpage, it can be added later.

Scenario B: discussion using Disqus
3b. Student posts a comment to notify group through disqus with @username1, @username2, etc. This requires email notifications in Disqus are activated.
4b. GOALI group members provide thoughts by posting comments.

5. Student addresses comments with Disqus/email, updated post, new Git Page, or in the next meeting.
