# Git Pages or Github Pages#
This is a git page. We are using git pages to replace word documents, powerpoint presentations, emails, etc. that you would typically use to describe research concepts on a day to day basis to other researchers. The main advantages are centrality and accessibility saving time wasted looking for emails, attachments, documents that are buried and/or outdated.

# Disqus  
Disqus is an comment posting service used by many different web services including Github. Anyone with a Disqus account can leave comments on a git page, no Github account required.

# Workflow using Git Pages and Disqus in between physical meetings #

## Begin ##
- Student has some results or question which requires some discussion.
- Student makes a git page on the GOALI project website.

## Scenario A: discussion through email ##
- Student emails the GOALI group that their input is desired, includes link to git page.
- GOALI group members provide thoughts through email. If information is generated that should be included on a gitpage, it can be added later.

## Scenario B: discussion using Disqus ##
- Student posts a comment to notify group through disqus with @username1, @username2, etc. This requires email notifications in Disqus are activated.
- GOALI group members provide thoughts by posting comments.

## End/Iterate ##
- Student addresses comments with Disqus/email, updated post, new Git Page, or in the next meeting.
