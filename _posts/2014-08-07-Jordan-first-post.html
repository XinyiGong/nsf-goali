# Jordan's First Post

## Bio

Jordan is a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech in the Materials Informatics for Engineering Design {% include ContentManager.html content=page.link1 %} Research Group. Jordan completed his Master's at Drexel University and Bachelor's from Temple University both in Mechanical Engineering. The focus of his thesis work is developing protocols to accurately characterize length scale effects in titanium alloys including the effects of interfaces using spherical instrumented indentation.

## Project Responsibilities

### Spherical Nanoindentation
Recent spherical nanoindentation protocols have proven valuable for characterizing the local mechanical response of different materials systems in the form of indentation stress-strain curves [1-4]. For Ti alloys this is the grain scale response which depends on the phase (hcp, bcc) and crystal orientation. Indentation has the advantage of being cheap and high-throughput compared to other grain scale mechanical testing methods. Grain scale mechanical property measurements are needed to accurately capture the grain scale plastic anisotropy in Ti alloys to improve the accuracy of crystal plasticity simulations for predicting fatigue and failure.

### Spherical Micro/Macro/Meso Indentation
Grain scale indentation measurements do not account for the effect of grain and phase boundaries or microtextures. Indentation measurements at the meso scale probe multiple phases and grains at one time to establish length scale effects going from single grains and single phases all the way to bulk properties. The characterization of these length scale effects are needed to properly implement crystal plasticity models calibrated to grain scale measurements.

### InSEM Nanoindentation
Interface modeling is an area of ongoing research which is limited by the lack of available experimental datasets for information and calibration. With a unique setup of a wedge indenter inside an SEM, single interfaces can be probed while simultaneously characterizing the deformation in the indentation zone using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). These experiments provide a rich amount of information for improving interface modeling, particularly the alpha-beta interface in Ti alloys.

### Structure Characterization for WSVEs
Large electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data sets will be collected on orthogonal sections for generating representative volume elements (RVEs) for crystal plasticity finite element simulations. The spatial statistics (2-point) of the microstructure will be used to generate the RVE rather than predetermined feature measurements and distributions which will provide a more statistically meaningful RVE or a set of weighted statistically meaningful RVEs (WSVEs) [5-6].
