## Background

One of the major purposes of performing spherical nanoindentation experiments is for the further refinement of the CPFEM parameters.  In the past, these parameters have been calibrated to polycrystalline cyclic loading data.  However, spherical nanoindentation experiments can be performed on a single grain and thus represent a single crystal response to the deformation.  This is advantageous for the calibration of low-symmetry crystal structures that have CRSS values that vary widely with slip system.

For reference, Patel and Kalidindi (2014) have successfully performed spherical nanoindentation FEM simulations that were used to extract the elastic stiffness tensor for FCC materials.

## Initial FEM Meshes

Many 2D nanoindentation FEM simulations have been employed in the literature, but there are very few fully-3D simulations for nanoindentation (besides Patel and Kalidindi, 2014).  In this work, fully-3D simulations are required to look at the elastic and inelastic response of HCP crystal structures (such as Ti-64) loaded in an arbitrary direction.  As a side note, special loading directions with crystal symmetry would allow for the use of 2D simulations.  As for mesh development, Dipen Patel and Dr. Kalidindi have been nice enough to allow us to use the meshing algorithm for spherical nanoindentation that was developed in his research.

Before employing that meshing strategy, simple spherical nanoindentation CPFEM simulations were performed.  The material region is a cubic volume with a constant mesh density in all direction and the spherical indenter is modeled as a regid half-sphere.  The cubic volume has a sidelength of 20$\mu m$ and the mesh density varies from 20 to 50 elements per side (1$\mu m$ to 0.4$\mu m$ element sidelength).  An example simulation schematic is shown below.

A comparison of the force versus displacement response for a mesh with 20 elements per side and a mesh with 30 elements per side is shown in the figure below.  It is important to note the response has a slight oscillation.  This is most likely due to a lack of mesh refinement directly beneath the indenter.  As the material beneath the indenter deforms plastically, the stiffness of the overall response decreases.  But, when additional material is engaged by the indenter, it is elastically deforming, thus increasing the stiffness.

As the mesh is further refined, the oscillation becomes less apparent, as shown in the force versus displacement curve for the mesh with 50 elements per sidelength.

(insert 20 v 50 here)

In terms of computational time and resources, the constant mesh density simulations are compared in the table below.



In HCP material systems, it is convenient to employ the 4-index Miller-Bravais (M-B) coordinate system to describe slip directions and slip plane normals.  The basal plane contains three directions $$ (a_1, a_2, a_3) $$ that form angles of 120$$^\circ$$ with each other and one direction $$ (c) $$ that is perpendicular to the basal plane.  With this particular system, the symmetry of the directions is apparent through the shuffling of the 3 non-zero indices.  For example, the basal slip directions in the 4-index M-B coordinate system are $$ [\bar{1}2\bar{1}0] $$, $$ [\bar{2}110] $$, and $$ [\bar{1}\bar{1}20] $$.  

However, determining direction cosines directly from the 4-index M-B coordinate system can be somewhat confusing because it is not orthonormal.  Therefore, we will step through the procedure for moving from a 4-index M-B coordinate system to an orthonormal system.

The first step is to convert the 4-index system to a 3-index system.  This is done by eliminating the $$ a_3 $$ direction.  Let's assume the 4-index indices are $$ [ u v t w] $$ and the 3-index indices are $$ [U V W] $$.  The conversion follows:

$$ U = u - t; V = v - t; W = w $$

Now that we have a 3-direction coordinate sysem, A simple transformation is performed to convert the 3-index M-B $$ [U V W] $$ to the orthonormal system $$ [x, y, z] $$.  The conversion follows:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{c}{a} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} U \\ V \\ W \end{bmatrix} $$

Note that this transformation aligns two directions, $$ a_1 \| x $$ and $$ c \| z $$.
