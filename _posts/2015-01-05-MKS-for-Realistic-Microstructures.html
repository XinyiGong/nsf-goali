## Introduction




While the entire hexagonal-triclinic fundamental zone covers  $ 0 \leq \phi_1 \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \Phi < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \phi_2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3} $, only orientations in the $ \phi_2 = 0 $ face were used as $ \phi_2 $ has no influence on the GSH coefficients at the L = 4 truncation level.
