### MKS Calibration and Validation for Dream3D Microstructures  

The purpose of this effort was to benchmark the MKS in the prediction of LE strain fields for a variety of calibration and validation microstructures.

**Random**, **Delta**, and **Equiaxed** microstructures were chosen for this effort as described below:

**Random**: Each voxel in the microstructure is randomly assigned an orientation

**Delta**: The entire microstructure is assigned one orientation except for the center cell which is assigned a different orientation

**Equiaxed**: A microstructure with a realistic grain structure as generated by Dream3D where an orientation is randomly assigned to each grain

For the calibration microstructures orientations were selected from the $ \phi_2 = 0 $ face of the hexagonal triclinic fundamental zone ( $ 0 \leq \phi_1 \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \Phi < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \phi_2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3} $ ). These orientations are shown in the following image:

Orientations for the validation microstructures were randomly assigned from a preselected set of 4800 orientations in the hexagonal triclinic fundamental zone.

The following chart shows the errors associated with each combination of 100 calibration simulations and 25 validation simulations:

The following image shows the predicted strain fields for a slice of a realistic microstructure, where 100 delta microstructures are used for calibration.

In addition, the influence coefficients calculated from the set of 100 random microstructures were used to predict the strain fields for delta microstructures. The image below shows the predicted strain field for an example delta microstructure.
