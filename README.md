Every image has a 11 digit photo-id, for example:

https://www.flickr.com/photos/123578762@N06/14523859440/

photo-id: 14523859440

So when you go to link above, after '/' add sizes/l and will get you to
all sizes page like the example below:

https://www.flickr.com/photos/123578762@N06/14523859440/sizes/l

By dragging the image to address bar (Where we type www. .... .com), you will
get a url like the example below:
https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5578/14523859440_3e28e8b469_m.jpg
            |                   |       |           |      |
          farm                server    |           |     size
                                    photo-id      secret
